Moonstone AG Store: https://invigoro.github.io/rpg-megamartv3/agmoonstone.html

To set up your own store on GitHub:
- Fork the repository
- Go to your new repository's settings tab
- Navigate to 'pages' in the settings list
- Enable pages, and wait a few minutes for it to deploy. You've now got a publicly hosted website you can access.
- The URL for this storefront is https://{your username}.github.io/{repository name}/{storefront name}.html. For example, https://invigoro.github.io/rpg-megamartv3/template.html

To make a new store:
- Duplicate a template.js file from the data folder and give it a new name
- Duplicate a template.html file and give it a new name
- Change the script reference in your new .html file to your new data file

To view your store locally:
- Navigate to the folder containing your code
- Open the storefront html file (e.g template.html) with any browser
